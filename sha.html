            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The SHA family is a collection of cryptographic hash functions that provide secure, fixed length
                digests. They are used in many areas of modern computing, including digital signatures, integrity
                protection, password hashing, and secure communication protocols. SHA standards have evolved over time
                as weaknesses were discovered in older algorithms and new requirements emerged. Today the SHA family is
                one of the most widely used cryptographic building blocks in the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                The SHA family includes SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3. SHA-1 belongs to an older generation and is no longer
                considered safe for applications that rely on collision resistance. SHA-2 remains the most commonly
                deployed version because it is secure, fast, and well supported. Finally SHA-3 introduces a new internal
                structure and avoids design decisions that limited previous generations. Together these algorithms show
                how cryptographic standards change over time and how new techniques replace older ones in order to
                maintain security.

            <h2>SHA-1 (Legacy)</h2>
            <p>
                SHA-1 was released in the nineties and quickly became a standard for digital signatures, software
                updates, and certificate infrastructures. It produces a 160 bit digest and was the recommended choice
                for many years. Over time researchers discovered weaknesses that made it possible to create collisions
                much faster than expected. The first widely publicized practical collision was demonstrated in 2017 by
                the SHAttered project, proving that SHA-1 could no longer be trusted for applications where digest
                uniqueness is critical.
            </p>

            <p>
                After the SHAttered collision, major organizations and browser vendors deprecated SHA-1 completely.
                Today it should only be used for legacy compatibility and never for signatures or sensitive verification
                tasks. Attacks against SHA-1 are fully practical and can cause serious security failures in systems that
                still depend on it.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p class="note">
                SHA-1 should not be used for certificates, digital signatures, or security sensitive hashing.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="card" id="sha2">
            <h2>SHA-2 (Current Standard)</h2>
            <p>
                SHA-2 includes several variants: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. These versions differ in output
                length and internal parameters, but they share the same design principles. SHA-2 is considered secure
                and continues to be the standard choice for general hashing tasks. It is used in TLS, secure messaging,
                blockchain systems, digital signatures, and countless software frameworks.
            </p>

            <p>
                One limitation of SHA-2 is its vulnerability to length extension attacks when it is used incorrectly.
                These attacks can occur when developers attempt to authenticate messages by simply hashing a secret with
                the message. Using HMAC or SHA-3 avoids this issue entirely and is recommended for any scenario where a
                message must be authenticated or validated.
            </p>

            <h2>SHA-3 (Keccak)</h2>
            <p>
                SHA-3 represents a newer generation of hash functions that use an internal design called the sponge
                construction. This approach differs from older models and provides natural protection against
                length extension attacks. SHA-3 was selected through a multi year public competition that evaluated
                dozens of candidate algorithms. The result is a flexible, well understood, and highly secure standard
                that complements SHA-2 rather than replacing it outright.
            </p>

            <p>
                SHA-3 also inspired other high performance hashing functions such as BLAKE2 and BLAKE3, which combine
                fast performance with strong security guarantees. These developments show how quickly the field of
                cryptography continues to evolve.

                The following examples demonstrate how SHA-256 hashes can be cracked using Hashcat. The process begins
                by
                generating a SHA-256 hash and placing it into a file named sha256.txt. This ensures the same input is
                used every time and makes it easier to compare the effectiveness of each attack type.
