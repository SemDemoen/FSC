        <h1>Password Hash Attacks</h1>

        <p>Password hashing is a core defense mechanism used to protect stored passwords. However, attackers have developed
            techniques to guess, reverse, or bypass hashes using computing power, leaked databases, and precomputed lookup tables.
            Understanding these methods is essential for understanding why modern password hashing must include <strong>salts</strong>,
            <strong>slow algorithms</strong>, and <strong>strong password policies</strong>.</p>

        <!-- BRUTE FORCE -->
        <h2>Brute Force Attacks</h2>
        <p>A brute force attack is the most straightforward password‑cracking method: the attacker systematically tries
            <strong>every possible password combination</strong> until the correct one is found. Although simple, it becomes extremely
            powerful when combined with modern hardware and optimized cracking tools.</p>

        <p>The time required for brute force grows exponentially with the password length. For example, a 4‑character lowercase password
            has only 26⁴ possibilities, but an 8‑character password using letters, numbers, and symbols can have over 6×10¹⁵ possibilities.
            Because hash functions like MD5 or SHA‑1 are extremely fast, attackers can test billions of combinations per second on GPUs.</p>

        <p>To defend against brute force attacks, systems rely on <strong>slow hashing algorithms</strong> such as bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2,
            which intentionally require significant computation time. Adding salts does not stop brute force, but it ensures that each password
            must be cracked separately, greatly increasing the attacker's workload.</p>

        <!-- DICTIONARY -->
        <h2>Dictionary Attacks</h2>
        <p>A dictionary attack is more efficient than brute force because attackers do not try random combinations, they try
            <strong>likely passwords first</strong>. These dictionaries often contain:</p>

        <p>
            • common passwords like “123456” or “password”<br>
            • leaked passwords from previous data breaches<br>
            • variations such as “password1!”, “welcome2024”, or “qwerty123”<br>
        </p>

        <p>Most users reuse passwords or choose predictable patterns. Attackers exploit this by starting with the most common passwords,
            which frequently succeed. Dictionary attacks are extremely effective against weak password policies and are usually the first
            method attempted when a password hash database is leaked.</p>

        <p>Even users who think their passwords are “complex” often follow predictable patterns, making rule‑based dictionary attacks,
            where attackers automatically add numbers, capital letters, or symbols, even more successful.</p>

        <!-- RAINBOW TABLES -->
        <h2>Rainbow Table Attacks</h2>
        <div class="critical-visual fancy-diagram">

            <p>Rainbow tables are massive databases of <strong>precomputed hashes</strong>. Instead of hashing each guess during an attack,
                attackers can simply look up a hash in these tables and instantly learn the matching password. This makes them extremely
                dangerous, but only against <strong>unsalted</strong> hashes.</p>

            <p>If two people use the same password, their unsalted hashes are identical, meaning a single lookup can break millions of 
                accounts at once. This made rainbow tables a major threat during the early 2000s when many systems stored simple MD5 or SHA‑1 hashes.</p>

            <div class="fancy">
                <div class="icon-circle">dog</div>
                <p>Hash → 06d80eb0</p>
            </div>
            <div class="connector">or</div>
            <div class="fancy">
                <div class="icon-circle">cat</div>
                <p>Hash → 9f9d51bc</p>
            </div>
            <div class="connector">or</div>
            <div class="fancy">
                <div class="icon-circle">pig</div>
                <p>Hash → d0763edaa</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Rainbow tables are huge, some sets can exceed terabytes of storage, and creating them requires enormous computation time. This is
            why they only work when the same hash function is used consistently and without salts. A single unique salt breaks the entire
            rainbow table technique because every password would need its own table.</p>

        <!-- HASHCAT -->
        <h2>Hashcat and GPU Cracking</h2>
        <p>Hashcat is a powerful password‑cracking tool capable of trying billions or even trillions of hashes per second using modern GPUs.
            It's considered the industry standard for testing password strength and evaluating the security of hashing algorithms.</p>

        <p>Hashcat supports multiple attack modes, including:</p>

        <p>
            • <strong>Brute force:</strong> testing every possible combination.<br>
            • <strong>Dictionary:</strong> testing lists of passwords.<br>
            • <strong>Rule‑based:</strong> applying mutations like “123”, capital letters, or symbol substitutions.<br>
            • <strong>Hybrid:</strong> combining dictionary words with brute‑force patterns.<br>
        </p>

        <p>Hashcat demonstrates why password hashing must be intentionally slow. Hashing algorithms like MD5, SHA‑1, or SHA‑256 are so fast
            that GPUs can compute them at incredible speed. By contrast, bcrypt or Argon2 are designed to resist GPU acceleration, making
            each guess significantly slower and dramatically reducing attack feasibility.</p>

        <!-- SALTING -->
        <h2>Salting</h2>
        <div class="critical-visual fancy-diagram">

            <p>A salt is a <strong>unique random value added to each password</strong> before hashing. The purpose is not to make the hash
                harder to compute, it is to ensure the hash is unique even if two users choose the same password. Salting completely destroys
                rainbow table attacks because precomputing hashes becomes impossible.</p>

            <p>Even more importantly, salting forces attackers to crack each password individually. Without salts, cracking one password 
                might reveal thousands more. With salts, every password requires its own brute‑force or dictionary attempt, making large‑scale
                attacks significantly slower and more expensive.</p>

            <div class="fancy">
                <div class="icon-circle">dog</div>
                <div class="plus">+</div>
                <div class="salt-box">A92</div>
                <div class="arrow">=</div>
                <div class="hash-box highlight">a6f9c3e91</div>
            </div>
            <div class="connector">≠</div>
            <div class="fancy">
                <div class="icon-circle">dog</div>
                <div class="plus">+</div>
                <div class="salt-box">X33</div>
                <div class="arrow">=</div>
                <div class="hash-box highlight">91b8f2ac1</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Salts alone are not enough, fast hashing functions are still vulnerable, but when combined with slow algorithms like bcrypt or
            Argon2, they create a powerful defense that makes password cracking extremely time‑consuming and costly for attackers.</p>

        <!-- SUMMARY -->
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Password hash attacks rely on speed, predictability, and the absence of modern protections. Brute force attacks test every 
            possibility, dictionary attacks exploit predictable passwords, and rainbow tables break unsalted hashes instantly. Tools like 
            Hashcat accelerate these attacks using GPUs capable of billions of operations per second. To defend against them, systems use 
            salts, slow hashing functions, and strong password policies that greatly increase the difficulty and cost of cracking attempts.</p>
