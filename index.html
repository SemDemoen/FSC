        <h1>Introduction to Hash Functions</h1>

        <p>Hash functions are one of the most fundamental concepts in computer security. At their core, they take an
            input of arbitrary length, such as: a password, a file, or a message, and produce a fixed-length output
            called a <strong>hash</strong> or <strong>digest</strong>. This output acts as a digital fingerprint of
            the original data. Any small change in the input, even just a single character, will produce a drastically
            different hash. This property is called the <strong>avalanche effect</strong> and is crucial for
            detecting tampering or unauthorized modifications.</p>

        <p>Hash functions are deterministic, meaning that the same input will always produce the same hash. They are
            designed to be fast, efficient, and irreversible, so it is practically impossible to derive the original
            input from its hash alone. This makes them invaluable in password storage, data integrity verification,
            and cryptographic protocols.</p>

        <h2>Key Properties of Hash Functions</h2>
        <p>Understanding the core properties of hash functions helps explain why they are so critical in
            cybersecurity. First, they are <strong>deterministic</strong>: identical inputs produce identical hashes.
            Second, they exhibit <strong>preimage resistance</strong>, making it extremely difficult to recover the
            original input from the hash. Third, they provide <strong>second preimage resistance</strong>, ensuring
            that finding a different input producing the same hash is computationally infeasible.</p>

        <p>Another crucial property is <strong>collision resistance</strong>, which prevents two different inputs
            from producing the same hash. Finally, hash functions are designed for <strong>fast computation</strong>
            and must maintain the <strong>avalanche effect</strong>, where small changes in input drastically alter
            the hash output. These properties collectively ensure integrity, security, and reliability.</p>

        <h2>Applications of Hash Functions</h2>
        <p>Hash functions are used in countless areas of computer security. One of the most common is password
            storage. Instead of storing plaintext passwords, systems store hashes, which makes it difficult for
            attackers to retrieve the original passwords even if the database is stolen. This is a critical layer of
            protection for user data.</p>

        <p>Hashes are also widely used for data integrity verification. Files, software downloads, and messages can
            be checked against their hash to ensure they have not been modified or tampered with. Digital signatures
            rely on hashes to authenticate messages and confirm that they come from the claimed sender.</p>

        <p>In cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, hashes link blocks of transactions in a blockchain. The cryptographic
            properties of hash functions prevent tampering, ensure the integrity of the chain, and make altering
            transaction history computationally infeasible. Hash functions are also used for checksums, error
            detection, and other cryptographic protocols.</p>

        <h2>Why Hash Functions Are Critical</h2>
        

        <div class="critical-visual attack-diagram-fixed">
            <p>Weak or broken hash functions can compromise entire systems. Attackers may exploit collisions or reverse
            hashes to gain unauthorized access, forge documents, or manipulate data. This is why modern cryptography
            uses secure hash functions with strong mathematical properties, making attacks extremely costly or
            impossible. <i>hover over a box to get more info</i></p>
