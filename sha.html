        <h1>SHA Family</h1>

        <h2>SHA-1</h2>
        <p>SHA-1 was widely used for years but is now considered broken. In 2017, Google and CWI Amsterdam demonstrated
            the first practical SHA-1 collision attack (SHAttered).</p>

        <h2>SHA-2</h2>
        <p>SHA-2 (SHA-256, SHA-512, etc.) is currently secure and remains the standard in most systems, including TLS,
            digital signatures, and blockchain applications.</p>

        <h2>SHA-3</h2>
        <p>SHA-3, based on the Keccak sponge construction, is a newer hash standard designed as a fallback in case
            weaknesses in SHA-2 were ever discovered.</p>

        <h2>Known Vulnerabilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SHA-1:</strong> Collision attacks (SHAttered), chosen-prefix attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>SHA-2:</strong> No practical attacks known; only theoretical analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>SHA-3:</strong> No practical vulnerabilities; designed differently to avoid weaknesses of
                Merkle–Damgård construction.</li>
        </ul>
