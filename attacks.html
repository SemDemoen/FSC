        <h1>Password Hash Attacks</h1>
        <p>This page describes common attacks on password hashes such as brute-force, dictionary attacks, rainbow
            tables, and GPU-accelerated cracking using tools like Hashcat.</p>

        <h2>Brute Force Attacks</h2>
        <p>Brute force attempts every possible character combination until a matching hash is found. Strong hashing
            algorithms and long passwords reduce feasibility.</p>

        <h2>Dictionary Attacks</h2>
        <p>Attackers use wordlists containing common passwords or leaked password databases to quickly test likely
            matches.</p>

        <h2>Rainbow Table Attacks</h2>
        <p>Rainbow tables store precomputed hashes for huge sets of passwords, allowing attackers to reverse hashes
            rapidly — but only if the hash is unsalted.</p>

        <h2>Hashcat</h2>
        <p>Hashcat is a GPU-accelerated password cracking tool capable of trying billions of hashes per second. It
            supports dictionary, hybrid, brute force, and rule-based attacks.</p>

        <h2>Salting</h2>
        <p>Adding a unique, random salt to each password prevents rainbow table attacks and makes cracking much harder,
            as each salted hash must be cracked individually.</p>
