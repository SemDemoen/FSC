            <h1>MD5</h1>

            <p>
                MD5 is a hash function that produces a 128-bit digest. It was introduced in the early nineties and was
                quickly adopted across many systems because it was easy to implement and extremely fast. For a long
                time, MD5 was considered reliable enough for verifying file integrity, generating checksums, and
                helping authenticate users. As cryptanalysis improved, weaknesses in the design became more visible,
                and eventually researchers created practical attacks that showed how easy it was to generate two
                different messages with the same MD5 hash. At that point it was clear that MD5 could not be considered
                secure anymore.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today MD5 still appears in older applications and in situations where there is no real risk of
                tampering. Even so, any system that uses MD5 for security should be updated. Modern alternatives such as
                SHA-256 or SHA-3 offer much stronger protection while still being efficient enough for real-world use.
                Understanding how MD5 works and why it failed is useful because it highlights what makes a hash function
                secure and why cryptographic standards evolve over time.

        <h2>What Is MD5?</h2>
        <p>
            MD5 stands for Message Digest Algorithm 5. It takes an input of any size and converts it into a fixed 32
            character output written in hexadecimal. When it first appeared, MD5 was considered one of the most stable
            and dependable tools for verifying data. It was used in digital signatures, password hashing, and even in
            parts of the early SSL ecosystem. The goal of MD5 was to make it extremely unlikely for two different
            inputs to produce the same digest. With time it became clear that this goal was not fully achieved.
        </p>

        <h2>How MD5 Works</h2>
        <p>
            MD5 splits the input into blocks, processes each block through a set of operations, and updates an internal
            state until the entire message is consumed. These operations include modular addition and bitwise logical
            functions. The final state becomes the output hash. The design was intended to make it hard to reverse the
            process and recover the original message. Although clever at the time, the internal structure was not
            strong enough to withstand modern cryptanalysis.
        </p>

        <h2>Weaknesses of MD5</h2>
        <p>
            MD5 is vulnerable to several serious weaknesses. The most well known problem is that attackers can create
            two different inputs that have the same digest. This completely breaks digital signatures, version control
            trust, and almost any system that relies on the hash being unique. MD5 is also very fast to compute. While
            this seemed like an advantage in the past, it now means that attackers can brute force huge numbers of
            guesses per second using GPUs or cloud platforms.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Collision attacks:</strong> Different inputs can produce identical digests.</li>
            <li><strong>Weak preimage protection:</strong> Easier than intended to reverse or guess inputs.</li>
            <li><strong>Fast to compute:</strong> Makes password cracking more effective.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Famous MD5 Attacks</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most influential MD5 attacks was created by cryptologist Vlastimil Klima, who demonstrated how
            collisions could be generated within minutes. This changed the perception of MD5 from "weak but usable" to
            "completely unsafe". Other researchers later created two different PDF files that shared the exact same MD5
            digest, proving that attackers could exploit this in real-world scenarios. Some malware authors even used
            MD5 collisions to disguise malicious files as legitimate ones.
        </p>

        <h2>MD5 in Practice Today</h2>
        <p>
            MD5 should not be used for anything involving security. However it is still common in places where the goal
            is simply to detect accidental file corruption. Software mirrors often publish MD5 checksums so users can
            verify that downloads completed correctly. This kind of use is safe because an attacker cannot change the
            file during download. Anything that depends on protecting data, verifying authenticity, or storing
            passwords must use a stronger hashing method.
        </p>

        <h2>Hashcat Example</h2>
        <p>
            The following section shows practical demonstrations of cracking an MD5 hash with Hashcat. Before running
            an attack we generate an MD5 hash and place it into a file called md5.txt. This ensures we always test the
            same input and allows us to compare different attack strategies.

        <h3>Dictionary Attack</h3>
        <p>
            The dictionary attack uses a wordlist and tests each entry to see if the hash matches. This works well when
            the password is based on a common word or phrase.
        </p>

        <h3>Bruteforce Attack</h3>
        <p>
            Bruteforce attempts every possible combination of characters within a defined set. It guarantees success
            but can take a long time when the password is large or complex.
        </p>

        <h3>Hybrid Attack</h3>
        <p>
            This method mixes a dictionary with additional characters, such as adding digits to the end of every word.
            Many passwords are built this way, which makes hybrid attacks extremely effective.
        </p>

        <h3>Rule Based Attack</h3>
        <p>
            Rule based attacks apply transformations to each word in a list, such as changing case, adding characters,
            or reversing the word. This creates a much larger and more effective set of possible passwords.
