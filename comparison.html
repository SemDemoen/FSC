            <h2>Function Speed</h2>
            <p>
                The speed at which a hash function operates is an important factor to consider, especially when
                dealing with password storage and verification. Hash functions like MD5 and SHA-1 are designed to be
                very fast, which makes them efficient for general-purpose computing. However, their high speed can be
                a disadvantage in security applications because attackers can attempt large numbers of guesses in a
                short period of time using modern hardware such as GPUs and specialized chips. More recent hash
                functions, such as SHA-256 and SHA-3, are slower and require more computational effort, which provides
                better protection against brute-force attacks while maintaining strong cryptographic properties.

            <h2>Resistance to Attacks</h2>
            <p>
                Hash functions differ significantly in their resistance to various cryptographic attacks. Collision
                resistance, which ensures that it is extremely difficult to find two different inputs that produce the
                same hash output, is a critical property for data integrity and authentication. Similarly, pre-image
                resistance protects against attempts to reverse a hash and recover the original input. MD5 and SHA-1
                are no longer considered secure because successful attacks have been demonstrated that compromise
                these properties. On the other hand, SHA-256 provides strong resistance against both collisions and
                pre-image attacks, making it suitable for most security applications. SHA-3, based on the Keccak
                algorithm, offers even higher levels of security and incorporates modern design principles to resist
                both current and future cryptanalytic attacks.

            <h2>Key Stretching</h2>
            <p>
                Key stretching is an essential technique used in password security to make brute-force attacks more
                difficult. The idea is to deliberately increase the computational effort required to hash a password
                by applying the hash function multiple times or using more complex algorithms. By doing so, even if an
                attacker obtains a database of hashed passwords, attempting to guess each password becomes much more
                time-consuming. This technique is particularly effective against attacks using modern hardware that
                can perform billions of hash calculations per second.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are several widely used algorithms for key stretching. PBKDF2 allows the number of iterations to
                be adjusted according to the desired level of security and computing power available. Bcrypt adds a
                salt to the password and includes a cost factor, which controls the number of iterations and makes
                attacks slower. Scrypt is designed to be memory-intensive in addition to computationally expensive,
                which helps resist attacks using specialized hardware such as GPUs and ASICs. Argon2 is the newest
                standard and combines memory hardness and parallelism for highly secure password hashing, making it the
                recommended choice for modern applications.
            </p>

            <p>Common key-stretching algorithms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PBKDF2</strong> – configurable iterations; widely used.</li>
                <li><strong>bcrypt</strong> – includes salt + cost factor.</li>
                <li><strong>scrypt</strong> – memory-hard; resists GPU/ASIC attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Argon2</strong> – newest standard; highly recommended.</li>
            </ul>
