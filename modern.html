        <h1>Modern Hash Functions</h1>

        <p><strong>Hash functions</strong> are a core building block of cybersecurity. At a basic level, they convert
            inputs of arbitrary length like passwords, files, or messages, into fixed-length strings called
            <strong>hashes</strong> or <strong>digests</strong>. These functions are used to ensure data integrity,
            protect passwords, and secure communications. Modern hash functions improve on older algorithms like MD5
            and SHA-1, which are now considered insecure.</p>

        <p>Modern hash functions are designed to resist a variety of attacks. They prevent collisions, where two
            different inputs produce the same hash, and preimage attacks, where attackers attempt to reverse a hash
            to find the original input. Additionally, they are efficient and scalable, allowing systems to hash large
            amounts of data quickly without performance issues.</p>

        <p>In practice, this means that when you store user passwords, verify software downloads, or sign digital
            documents, modern hash functions ensure that even small changes to the data are easily detected and that
            attackers cannot reverse-engineer the input without tremendous computational effort.</p>

        <h2>Collision Resistance</h2>
        <p><strong>Collision resistance</strong> means it is computationally infeasible to find two distinct inputs
            that produce the same hash. This property is essential in preventing attacks where an attacker could
            substitute malicious data without being detected. For instance, if a software update uses a hash to verify
            integrity, a collision could allow attackers to replace the update with malware that hashes to the same
            value.</p>

        <p>Modern algorithms like SHA-256 and SHA-3 are specifically designed to avoid collisions. Older algorithms,
            such as MD5, have been shown to produce collisions in practical scenarios, which is why they are
            deprecated. The design of SHA-3, for example, is based on the Keccak algorithm, which uses a sponge
            construction to ensure high resistance to collision attacks even against advanced adversaries.</p>

        <h2>Preimage Resistance</h2>
        <p><strong>Preimage resistance</strong> ensures that given a hash, it is extremely difficult to find any input
            that produces it. This is especially important for password storage. If a database of hashed passwords is
            leaked, preimage resistance ensures attackers cannot efficiently determine the original passwords.</p>

        <p>This property is also critical for digital signatures and integrity verification. Suppose a digital
            signature depends on a hash of a document. Preimage resistance guarantees that attackers cannot forge a
            document that matches an existing hash, maintaining authenticity and trust in the system.</p>

        <h2>Salting</h2>
        <p><strong>Salting</strong> strengthens password security by adding a unique, random string to each password
            before hashing. Even if two users choose the same password, their hashes will be different due to the
            salt. Salting is one of the most effective defenses against rainbow table attacks, which rely on precomputed
            hashes of common passwords.</p>

        <p>Salting forces attackers to brute-force each password individually, significantly increasing the time
            required to compromise an entire password database. When combined with cost factors or multiple hashing
            rounds, salting provides a strong layer of defense against modern cracking techniques.</p>

        <h2>Modern Hash Function Examples</h2>
        <p>There are several modern hash functions widely used in computer security:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>SHA-2 family:</strong> SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 are highly secure and used in TLS,
                blockchain, and digital signatures. They remain resistant to both collision and preimage attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>SHA-3:</strong> A newer standard using the Keccak algorithm, designed to avoid weaknesses
                found in SHA-1 and SHA-2. SHA-3 provides a different internal structure, improving security in certain
                use cases.</li>
            <li><strong>Bcrypt:</strong> Specifically designed for password hashing. It includes a unique salt for
                each password and configurable hashing rounds, making brute-force attacks slower and more
                computationally expensive.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Using these modern hash functions, along with proper salting and hashing rounds, ensures that sensitive
            information like passwords remains secure even if attackers gain access to the database.</p>

        <p>This diagram illustrates the progression from older, insecure hash functions to modern, secure designs.
            Choosing the correct algorithm is critical for protecting sensitive data and maintaining trust in digital
            systems.</p>

        <p>In summary, modern hash functions are robust, versatile, and essential for securing digital systems.
            Understanding collision resistance, preimage resistance, and the importance of salting is fundamental for
            anyone working with password security, digital signatures, or cryptographic protocols. Combining these
            techniques creates systems that remain secure even against highly capable adversaries.</p>
