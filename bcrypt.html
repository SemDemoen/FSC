        <h1>Bcrypt</h1>

        <p>
            Bcrypt is a dedicated password hashing algorithm that was created to slow down attackers and reduce the
            effectiveness of powerful modern hardware. While traditional hashing functions were originally built for
            general data integrity, bcrypt was built specifically to protect stored passwords by forcing an attacker
            to spend significantly more time and resources processing each guess. Even as GPUs and specialized hardware
            continue to improve, bcrypt remains secure because its difficulty can be increased over time through its
            cost factor.
        </p>



        <h2>What is Bcrypt?</h2>

        <p>
            Bcrypt was introduced in 1999 and is based on the Blowfish cipher. Unlike hashing algorithms such as MD5 or
            SHA-256, bcrypt includes features that make it suitable for password storage. It automatically handles
            salting
            and uses an adjustable work factor, allowing systems to increase the time required to compute a single hash
            as hardware becomes faster. These design choices make bcrypt highly resistant to large-scale cracking
            attempts
            and help limit the damage that can result from a database leak.
        </p>



        <h2>Key Features</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adaptive cost factor</strong> that can be increased to match hardware advances</li>
            <li><strong>Built-in 128-bit salt</strong> included in the hash output</li>
            <li><strong>Slow calculation</strong> that helps prevent large-scale brute-force attacks</li>
            <li><strong>Strong resistance to GPU and ASIC cracking</strong> due to its computation pattern</li>
        </ul>



        <h2>Bcrypt Hash Structure</h2>

        <p>
            A bcrypt hash contains everything needed to verify a password, including the version, cost, salt and final
            hash output. The structure is easy to parse and standardized across platforms, making bcrypt a reliable and
            predictable choice for authentication systems.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>$2b$</strong> – Version identifier</li>
            <li><strong>12</strong> – Cost factor (2^12 internal rounds)</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong> – 128-bit random value</li>
            <li><strong>Hash</strong> – 184-bit bcrypt output</li>

        <h2>Why Bcrypt Is Secure</h2>

        <p>
            Bcrypt is intentionally slow. This slow performance is not a flaw but the main reason it remains secure.
            By increasing the cost factor, systems force attackers to spend much more time computing each password
            attempt. A cost increase of just two steps can multiply the computation time by a factor of four. While
            fast functions such as MD5 and SHA-256 can be computed millions or billions of times per second, bcrypt
            deliberately restricts performance so that even modern GPUs can only compute a limited number of hashes
            each second.
        </p>

Cost 12 → 4,096 iterations
Cost 14 → 16,384 iterations</code></pre>

        <h2>Hashcat & Bcrypt</h2>

        <p>
            Bcrypt is one of the slowest algorithms to attack using Hashcat. Even though it can still be cracked, the
            time required makes brute-force attempts extremely impractical compared to fast hashes like MD5 or SHA-256.
            The slow performance is intentional and is the reason bcrypt is still commonly recommended for password
            storage in many real-world systems.
        </p>

            <h2>Hashcat Example</h2>

            <p>
                This section demonstrates how bcrypt behaves under Hashcat. For each attack type we use the same hash
                that was generated beforehand. It is important to include the <code>--potfile-disable</code> option if
                you have previously cracked the same hash because Hashcat normally stores results and may skip cracking
                if the password is already known.
            </p>

            <p>
                The hash used in this example was saved in a file named <strong>bcrypt.txt</strong>. All attack methods
                below are identical to the ones demonstrated for MD5 and SHA-256. The only change is the algorithm mode:
                instead of <code>-m 0</code> or <code>-m 1400</code>, bcrypt uses <code>-m 3200</code>.
            </p>
