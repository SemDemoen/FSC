        <h1>Modern Hash Functions</h1>
        <p>Modern cryptographic hash functions are designed to be secure against known attack techniques and efficient
            on modern hardware. They aim to provide strong collision resistance, preimage resistance, and protection
            against length-extension attacks.</p>

        <h2>SHA-2 Family</h2>
        <p>The SHA-2 family includes SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. These functions are widely used today in
            TLS, SSL, digital signatures, and blockchain systems such as Bitcoin. They are currently considered secure
            with no practical attacks known.</p>

        <h2>SHA-3 (Keccak)</h2>
        <p>SHA-3 was selected through an open competition organized by NIST. Based on the Keccak sponge construction, it
            differs significantly from SHA-1 and SHA-2. It offers strong security margins, resistance to
            length-extension attacks, and additional variants such as SHAKE128 and SHAKE256.</p>

        <h2>BLAKE & BLAKE2</h2>
        <p>The original BLAKE hash function was a finalist in the SHA-3 competition. Its successor, BLAKE2, provides
            even better performance and flexibility while maintaining the same strong security guarantees. BLAKE2 is
            faster than MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2 on most software platforms.</p>

        <h2>Other Modern Hash Functions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Whirlpool:</strong> A 512-bit hash based on a modified AES-like design.</li>
            <li><strong>Skein:</strong> Another SHA-3 finalist with a tweakable design for added flexibility.</li>
            <li><strong>RIPEMD-160:</strong> Still used in some applications such as Bitcoin addresses, though less
                common today.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Security Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Collision resistance:</strong> Hard to find two different inputs with the same hash.</li>
            <li><strong>Preimage resistance:</strong> Hard to derive the original message from its hash.</li>
            <li><strong>Second preimage resistance:</strong> Hard to find a different message with the same hash as a
                given message.</li>
            <li><strong>Resistance to length-extension attacks:</strong> Many modern hashes (e.g., SHA-3, BLAKE2) avoid
                this issue.</li>
        </ul>
